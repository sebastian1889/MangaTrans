## 🌟 Usage Instructions  
Once MangaTrans is running, you will need to provide a manga or manhwa image file. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure your image file is in a supported format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
2. Use the terminal to specify the path to your image file. For example:
   ```bash
   ./MangaTrans-latest path/to/your/image.png
   ```
3. The program will process the image, perform OCR, and translate the text.
4. Upon completion, it will generate a JSON file in the same directory or in a specified output directory.
